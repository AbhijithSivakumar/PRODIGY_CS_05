To run this code, firstly install scapy, a python library used for network packet manipulation, analysis, and forging.
Then we need to install npcap;
Npcap is a packet capture and injection library for Windows, developed by the Nmap Project. It's essentially the modern replacement for the older WinPcap library, which is no longer maintained.
If you are using older windows versions like 7 or below that you could go for WinPCAP.
Now we are all set to run the code and start sniffing packets.
